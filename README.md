- Ruby on Rails : Back-end framework used for User-Authorization

- React Js : Interactive front-end framework

- SQL: Database 
- Heroku: Deployment website
- GitHub: REpository hosting service

## My Approach
My general approach to creating this app started with what I wanted this app to accomplish and who I wanted to target. After I narrowed the target audience I then started on some of the back-end work. I tried a few new things that were not taught in class, for example I used a cornerstone gem called "devise" that takes care of all the controllers necessary for user creation. I ran into some errors so I switched my focus to the front-end work. I was able to create and interactive front-end used to find other users on the app with the ability to connect through mutual like. 


 With the front end basically set up I had to do more research on the backend work. Not being too well versed in backend work I came to the conclusion after talking with my team leader that maybe it wasn't the best idea to use something I didn't fully understand so I went back to old zoom videos that J made showing us how she incorporated auth with react. 

While running into error after error I decided to depoloy my app to heroku and style my app so I could get that out of the way.
